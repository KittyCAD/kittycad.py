This project generates a Python SDK for our API based on an OpenAPI spec in
`spec.json`.

All the code for the SDK is generated by scripts in the `generate/` folder.

The SDK lives in the `kittycad/` folder.

YOU CANNOT MANUALLY EDIT ANY FILES IN THE `kittycad/` folder EXCEPT:

- client.py
- types.py
- kittycad/test/\* except text_examples.py
- kittycad/models/base64data.py
- kittycad/models/empty.py

EVERYTHING else is a generated file and you should instead update the `generate`
scripts and functions.

We aim to make this SDK as idiomatic to python developers as possible using the OpenAI
SDK as inspiration.

We also try to write simple and idiomatic python in the `generate/` logic.

As you make changes run `just generate` to generate a new sdk and make sure you didn't break anything.

If you make a breaking change add it to the CHANGELOG.md with a guide for users as to how to migrate.
