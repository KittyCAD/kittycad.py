The Python API client for KittyCAD.

This is generated from
[openapi-generators/openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client).

## Generating

You can trigger a build with the GitHub action to generate the client. This will
automatically update the client to the latest version of the hosted API at
[api.kittycad.io](https://api.kittycad.io).

Alternatively, if you wish to generate the client locally, make sure you have
[Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and run:

```bash
$ make generate
```

Please do not change the code directly since it is generated. PRs that change
the code directly will be automatically closed by a bot.
